ActionMailer is awesome. The deficiency is all mine, but frankly I don't want 
to maintain a bunch of templates somewhere. I just want to have a string that I
can email. This lets you send email directly and immediately without having to
maintain the templates. We use it for managing automatic deploy emails from 
within capistrano.

Let's see if we can get that down to 5 lines? 

action_mailer_with_temporary_delivery_method do
  mail = TMail::Mail.new
  mail.subject,      = "email is awesome"
  mail.to, mail.from = "tips@nytimes.com", ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings[:user_name]
  mail.date          = Time.now
  mail.body          = "Look ma, I'm sending email without bleeding"
  ActionMailer::Base.deliver(mail)
end

Ok, it's not 5 lines, someone would have to be clever and and wrap that with:

def do_my_bidding
  action_mailer_with_temporary_delivery_method do
    mail = TMail::Mail.new
    mail = yield mail
    ActionMailer::Base.deliver(mail)
  end
end

do_my_bidding do |mail|
  mail.subject,      = "email is awesome"
  mail.to, mail.from = "tips@nytimes.com", ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings[:user_name]
  mail.date          = Time.now
  mail.body          = "Look ma, I'm sending email without bleeding"
  mail
end

Knock yourselves out. Email shouldn't be hard. It's 2009. Email was hard when 
dinosaurs and glaciers raced each other to the equator. To install drop it into
RAILS_ROOT/lib and require it from environment.rb
