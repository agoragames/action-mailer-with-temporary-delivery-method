We needed to send an email from within capistrano every time we were going to 
do a deploy. 

I did a blog post on this subject here:

What's different when you're using this plugin is instead of having all the 
temporary delivery method crap in your actual recipe you just put this at the top:

require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'lib', 'action_mailer_with_temporary_delivery_method')
self.class.send(:include, ActionMailerWithTemporaryDeliveryMethod)

And now you're ready to rock in the manner described in the blog post.
